## Overview of the analysis:

For this project, the languages of javaScript and HTML will be used and woven together in effort to assemble a UFO Sightings webpage with a functional search filter. With JavaScript as the backbone, the website will use data that is stored in a JavaScript array/list, and enhance the HTML experience while providing a well balanced visual table that will show all the data for UFO sightings across the country.

## Results:

figure 1 - full WebPage (No Filter)

Figure 1 above displays the homepage of the project. From the figure, towards the bottom is where both the filter table and the search results are shown, because there are no filters added at the moment, all that data that is present is displayed.

figure 2 - filtered table

Figure 2 above displays the data that is given when the date "1/10/2010" is entered. In the table on the left, The search results are being filtered by the date filter, on the right are the results from the filter. 

figure 3 - two filters

Figure 3 above illustrates the ability to make multiple searches at once, narrowing down the data using just two filters.

## Summary:
Drawbacks:
  A drawback for this webpage is the case sensitivity of the filters. Because the filters are case sensitive, "San Diego'' will not bring up results that are defined under "san diego" due to the use of capitalization. 
  
Recommendations: 
One recommendation for this website is to bypass the case sensitivity within the filters. Another recommendation would be to clean up the table. The table displays cities, States, Countries, etc, without the use of capitalizations, making it look unprofessional. Furthermore, the Duration column could be made better by using the form "00:00:00" as opposed to "5 hours'' or "3 minutes." A "duration" filter would also be a great addition to the filter Search.
